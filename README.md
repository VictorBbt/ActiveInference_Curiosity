# ActiveInference_Curiosity
Analysis of Karl Friston's work on Active Inference, Curiosity and Insight done for Jean-Pierre Nadal's MVA class for which I received the grade of 17/20 (A).

For the implementation, I delved into [this great repository](https://github.com/VictorBbt/pymdp) that contains hands-on tutorials on Active Inference !
